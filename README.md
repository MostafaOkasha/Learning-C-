# Learning C++
### This is where I will document my entire learning process for C++ including examples from cracking the coding interview and my understanding through them.

##### Things to note for being a good programmer and SDE:

- Deep understanding of Data structures and Algorithms.
- Ability to translate algorithms into code.
- Ability to write bug free code.
- Ability to write formal code (not pseudocode).
- Ability to write elegant code.
- How well can you "teach" others your solution?

Analytical abilities include how you can reason about the space time and runtime complexities of a solution and discuss their tradeoffs and the cracking the coding interview book goes into a lot of detail on this.

Know when to use the right DS at the right time.
Moreover, you should know all the internals of all basic data structures and how they are actually implemented (yes some interviewers do ask you to implement them).

You need to practice writing elegant and clean code and force yourself to use the good programming practices.

­ BFS/DFS

­ Construct a BST from a sorted array

­ Check if two trees are mirror image of each other

­ Find max path sum in the tree, negative nodes possible

­ Hashtables

­ Questions where you need to keep track of multiple occurences of same object

­ Questions where you want to have a 2 tuple as a key

­ Dynamic programming:

­ Given you can climb 1,2, or 3 stairs in one step, how many ways of reaching the

top

­ How many ways to go from top left of a grid to bottom right of the grid with some

obstacles in between

­ Implement both bottom up and top down solutions for both of the above
