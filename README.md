# Learning C++
### This is where I will document my entire learning process for C++ including examples from cracking the coding interview and my understanding through them.

##### Things to note for being a good programmer and SDE:

- Deep understanding of Data structures and Algorithms.
- Ability to translate algorithms into code.
- Ability to write bug free code.
- Ability to write formal code (not pseudocode).
- Ability to write elegant code.
- How well can you "teach" others your solution?

Analytical abilities include how you can reason about the space time and runtime complexities of a solution and discuss their tradeoffs and the cracking the coding interview book goes into a lot of detail on this.

Know when to use the right DS at the right time.
Moreover, you should know all the internals of all basic data structures and how they are actually implemented (yes some interviewers do ask you to implement them).

You need to practice writing elegant and clean code and force yourself to use the good programming practices.

- Basic Programming:
   - Data Types
   - Iteration, Recursion, Decision
   - Procedure, functions and scopes

- Arrays/Strings:
   - Determine if a string is a palindrome
   - Merge two sorted arrays
   - Reverse an array in place
   - Find substring
   - All sorting algorithms
   - Binary search in a sorted rotated array
   - Max profit stock problem
   - Matrix multiplication
   - Find all duplicates in an array
   - Print a matrix in a spiral manner

- Linked List:
   - Reverse a singly linked list
   -  Delete/Insert a node in a linked list
   - Detect if there is a cycle in the list and return its starting point
   - Merge two sorted lists
   - Split a list into two lists one has even indexes other has odd indexes

- Trees:
   - Check if tree is balanced
   - All traversals, recursive and iterative implementations
   - BFS/DFS
   - Construct a BST from a sorted array
   - Check if two trees are mirror image of each other
   - Find max path sum in the tree, negative nodes possible
   - Lowest common ancestor of 2 nodes in a tree

- Backtracking:
   - Find all permutations or combinations
   - Find all possible subsets
   - N queens problem
   - Convert numbers into words according to letters on an old phone keypad
 
 - Hashtables
   - Questions where you need to keep track of multiple occurences of same object
   - Questions where you want to have a 2 tuple as a key

- Dynamic programming:
   - Given you can climb 1,2, or 3 stairs in one step, how many ways of reaching the top
   - How many ways to go from top left of a grid to bottom right of the grid with some obstacles in between
   - Implement both bottom up and top down solutions for both of the above


--------

## C++ is a statically typed, compiled, general-purpose, case-sensitive, free-form programming language that supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming. C++ is regarded as a middle-level language, as it comprises a combination of both high-level and low-level language features.

## C++ is a superset of C, and that virtually any legal C program is a legal C++ program. BUT NOT VICE VERSA!!!!

-----------

C++ fully supports object-oriented programming, including the four pillars of object-oriented development:
- Encapsulation
- Data hiding
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism

-------------

Standard C++ consists of three important parts:
- The core language giving all the building blocks including variables, data types and literals, etc.
- The C++ Standard Library giving a rich set of functions manipulating files, strings, etc.
- The Standard Template Library (STL) giving a rich set of methods manipulating data structures, etc.

-----------

C++ is being highly used to write device drivers and other softwares that rely on direct manipulation of hardware under realtime constraints. file extension: cpp but doesnt matter.
